# Regression Test

## Introduction

Test module built from NodeJS for my PortFolio.

To run the test, do the following:

- Navigate to [tests](.) directory

- Run `npm install`

- Run `node fullRegression.js [production|regression]` or execute [fullRegression.js](./fullRegression.js) in the IDE

**NOTE**: Should not use `npm test` since it cannot execute `blc` for some reasons (!?)
